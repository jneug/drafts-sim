# Drafts IDE

This is an editor for scripts that run in the [iOS App Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/).
Just clone the repository to your machine and open `index.html`. Done.

If you want to try it out, go to <http://drafts.neugebauer.cc>.

## Usage
Type some code into the editor, add some text in the draft field to run the code
on, select the script type from the dropdown, click "Run" and see what happens.

You can populate the editor from a drafts install url. Just copy the url into
the "Parse URL" field and click the button. If the action has mutliple action
steps, you may add  "&step=stepNumber" to the url, to select the script to load
into the editor.
